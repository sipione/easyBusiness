# CoreManage

CoreManage is a multi-user management system designed to help freelancers handle contracts, payments, cash flow, stakeholders, and subaccounts efficiently. The system is built with a .NET C# backend and a React or Blazor frontend, offering flexibility and extensibility.

## Features

- **Multi-User System**: Each freelancer can manage their own clients, contracts, payments, and cash flow independently.
- **Subaccounts**: Freelancers can create subaccounts for their clients to consult data such as progress.
- **Contracts & Payments**: Track contracts and payment statuses, including partial and full payments.
- **Custom Progress Tracking**: Option to track client progress and upload related documents.
- **File Uploads**: Supports uploading files such as profile pictures and PDFs.
- **User Roles**: Different user roles such as admin, freelancer, subaccount client.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (MVC architecture)
- **Frontend**: React or Blazor (future versions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (using EF Core)
- **Authentication**: JWT Authentication with role-based authorization
- **File Storage**: Local file system or cloud storage (depending on configuration)

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture with separated layers for services, repositories, and controllers:

```

### API Structure

- **Controllers**: Handles HTTP requests and orchestrates data flows.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects used to send and receive data.
- **Middlewares**: Handles cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and authentication.

### APP Structure

- **Services**: Contains application-level services (e.g., handling user authentication).
- **Use Cases**: Defines core business logic and how users interact with the system.

### REPO Structure

- **Repositories**: Handles database operations (CRUD) with entities.
- **Entities**: Represents data models for the application.
- **Data**: Manages database context and migrations.
