Here's an improved version of the README file based on your current folder structure:

# EasyBusiness

EasyBusiness is a management system tailored for freelancers and small business owners to efficiently manage contracts, payments, cash flow, stakeholders, and subaccounts. Built with a .NET C# backend, the system is designed to offer flexibility, scalability, and extensibility, with a future frontend implementation in React or Blazor.

## Features

- **Multi-User System**: Users can manage clients, contracts, and cash flows independently.
- **Subaccounts**: Allow clients to view progress, invoices, and other related data.
- **Financial Tracking**: Easily track payments, invoices, cash flow, income, and expenses.
- **Custom Progress Tracking**: Track project progress, manage stakeholders, and upload documents.
- **User Roles**: Includes various roles such as admin, user, and client.
- **File Uploads**: Upload files such as PDFs and images for contracts or profiles.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (MVC architecture)
- **Frontend**: React or Blazor (future versions)
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production) with Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based authorization
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (expandable to cloud storage)

## Folder Structure

The system follows a clean architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### API Structure

- **Controllers**: Define REST API endpoints for managing users, contracts, payments, and other entities.
- **DTOs**: Objects that shape the data between the API and the client.
- **Filters & Middlewares**: Handle common tasks like error logging, authorization, and custom filtering.

### APP Structure

- **Entities**: Core business models (e.g., User, Contract, CashFlow).
- **Services**: Contain business logic such as user registration, cash flow tracking.
- **Use Cases**: Describe scenarios of how users interact with the system to accomplish tasks.

### REPO Structure

- **Repositories**: Handle data persistence (e.g., database queries, CRUD operations).
- **Data**: Contains database context and migration scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- SQLite (for local development) or PostgreSQL (for production)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EasyBusiness.git
   cd EasyBusiness
   ```

2. Restore NuGet packages and build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the API:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project API
   ```

4. (Optional) Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project REPO
   ```

### Testing

Unit tests are located in the `Tests` directory. Run them using:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Version 1: Default entities and basic functionality.
- [ ] Version 2: Custom entities, detailed subaccount management.
- [ ] Version 3: Real-time analytics, notifications, and role expansion.
